## General Information

This project deals with portfolio and risk assessment which leads to credit loss caused by defaulters. The objective is to find out the key driving factors behind loan defaults.
- The dataset used for Exploratory Data Analysis contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.
- EDA process involved Data Understanding, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Analysis with Univariate, Segmented Univariate and Bivariate analysis and finally concluding overall observation on the key factors identifying defaulters.

## Conclusions
- Employee with 10+ years of experience and with term period 60 months with higher defaulter ratio. And in terms of number, we observed that 10+ years with 36 months are more in defaulters
- Maximum defaulters are those who have taken loan for Educational purpose with 60 months as term. And for Small Business, we observed that irrespective of term, the defaulter percentage is high
- Maximum defaulters are those who have taken loan with interest rate between 20-25 and for the analysis we can say that if the loan amount exceeds 15000, then the chances to pay the loan is low
- Maximum defaulters are those who have taken loan with lower annual income (less than 50000) irrespective of installment value
- Maximum defaulters are those who have taken loan with Grade G
- Maximum defaulters are those who have rented properties
- Maximum defaulters are those who are in low income group
- Irrespective of any verification status, with DTI more than 18.56 are the majority defaulters. When the Verification status is ‘verified’,  it is observed that the majority defaulters are from this category which might infer that the verification process needs to be improved, so that defaulter ratio gets minimised
- Low income group are the majority defaulter for all DTI. We also see a trend, with DTI higher than 18.560000 are majority defaulter except for Higher income group where the DTI ranging from 13.370000 to 18.560000 are majority defaulters
- Majority defaulters are those who have requested loan amount more than 14000 (for all DTIs). It even shows a trend on DTI with greater than 18.56 are the majority defaulter
- Employee with 10+ years experience are the majority defaulters. In general, DTI greater than 18.56 are the majority defaulter except in cases where the employee years of experience are for 4, 7 and 9 years, where DTI between 13.37 to 18.56 are majority defaulters
- Majority of Defaulters are from Grade G followed by Grade F
